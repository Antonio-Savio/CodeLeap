This project is a solution for the CodeLeap Frontend Developer assessment. It's a simple social network interface allowing users to sign up (using a username), create, read, edit, and delete posts, closely following the provided design specifications. This implementation goes beyond the core requirements by incorporating several bonus features using React, TypeScript and Firebase.

## Features

### Core Requirements Implemented:

*   **Signup:** Simple username entry screen, adhering to the design, with the "Enter" button disabled until a username is typed. (Enhanced with Firebase Auth - see Bonus Features).
*   **Post Creation:** Users can create new posts using a form with "Title" and "Content" fields. The "Create" button is disabled if either field is empty, matching the design specification.
*   **Post Feed:** Fetches and displays posts from the backend (Firebase).
*   **Real-time Updates:** The post list updates automatically when a new post is created.
*   **Post Sorting:** Posts are displayed with the most recent ones first.
*   **Conditional Edit/Delete Icons:** Edit (üìù) and Delete (üóëÔ∏è) icons are only visible on posts created by the currently logged-in user, as specified in the design.
*   **Edit Posts:** Users can edit their own posts via a modal pre-filled with the existing title and content.
*   **Delete Posts:** Users can delete their own posts, triggering a confirmation modal before proceeding.
*   **Clean & Consistent UI:** Adheres closely to the provided design mockups, focusing on layout, component appearance (modals, buttons, inputs), consistency, spacing, and usability.

### Bonus Features & Enhancements:

*   **Firebase Authentication:** Replaced simple username persistence with robust email/password authentication via Firebase Auth for a more realistic login/logout solution.
*   **Firebase Firestore:** Used as the backend database to store and retrieve posts and comments in real-time.
*   **Like/Unlike Posts:** Users can like and unlike posts, with counts updated visually.
*   **Real-time Comments:**
    *   Users can view and add comments to posts within a dedicated modal.
    *   Comments appear in real-time for all users viewing the post.
    *   Users can delete their own comments (indicated by a trash icon next to their comments).
*   **Image Uploads:** Users can optionally attach an image when creating a post. Images are uploaded and hosted on Cloudinary.
*   **"My Posts" Page:** A dedicated view showing only the posts created by the currently logged-in user.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** The interface adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Loading Indicators & Toasts:** Provides visual feedback for async operations and actions.
*   **Cloudinary Integration:** handles image storage and retrieval.
*   **Protected Actions:** Unauthenticated users attempting to Like, Comment, or Create a Post are redirected to the Sign In page.
*   **Route Protection:** Authenticated users attempting to access Sign In or Sign Up pages are redirected to the main feed.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Antonio-Savio/CodeLeap.git
    cd CodeLeap
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory, and fill in your Firebase and Cloudinary credentials.

    ```bash
    # Firebase Configuration
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
